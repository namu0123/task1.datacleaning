# Data Visualization & Storytelling — Project


**Objective:** Create visualizations that convey a compelling story from a dataset (Tableau / Power BI).


## Contents
- `data/` — raw and processed datasets
- `tableau/` or `powerbi/` — workbook files and exported images/PDFs
- `notebooks/` — optional EDA or data-transform scripts
- `deliverables/` — final Storyboard.pdf and Visual-Report.pdf


## How to reproduce
1. Open `data/raw/superstore.csv` and inspect `data/data-dictionary.md` for column meanings.
2. Run the notebooks (if provided) to reproduce cleaned data saved to `data/processed/`.
3. Open the workbook file in Tableau (`tableau/workbook.twbx`) or Power BI (`powerbi/report.pbix`).
4. Export dashboards to PDF and PNG using the "Export" or "Print to PDF" option.


## Deliverables (what's included)
- `deliverables/Storyboard.pdf` — 1–2 page narrative with context, key charts, and 3 action items.
- `deliverables/Visual-Report.pdf` — full multi-page report (screenshots or printed PDF of dashboard).
- `tableau/exports/` or `powerbi/exports/` — screenshots used in README.


## Design & storytelling checklist
- Use the right chart for the question (trend = line, distribution = histogram, part-to-whole = bar/stacked with caution).
- Avoid chart junk: keep color palette minimal (2–4 colors), use clear labels, and annotate key points.
- Add a title + one-line insight for every chart.
- Focus on business insights: what to do next, who is impacted, and the confidence in the insight.


## Example storyboard (short)
1. **Context & question** — What business problem are we answering?
2. **Top-level KPI** — single chart showing the headline metric.
3. **Drivers** — charts that explain what is driving the KPI.
4. **Recommendations** — 3 specific next steps based on data.


## How I exported final PDFs (steps you can follow)
### Tableau
- File → Export as PowerPoint or File → Print to PDF.
- Export each dashboard as PNG (Dashboard → Image).


### Power BI Desktop
- File → Export → PDF (or use the "Export current report page" to PNG via the ellipsis on a page).
- To get high-resolution images, use the built-in export rather than screenshots.


## Naming conventions
- Keep file names short and descriptive (e.g. `2025-Q4-Sales-Dashboard.pdf`).
- Use `snake_case` or `kebab-case` consistently.


## Useful git workflow
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: project structure and sample data"
# create repo on GitHub and push
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main

## Quick Storyboard — what to include on your 1–2 page Storyboard.pdf
- Title, date, author
- One-line summary (the headline insight)
- 3 supporting charts (each with 1-line caption + why it matters)
- 3 recommended actions (who, what, when)


---


## Short tips for chart choices (common scenarios)
- Time series (sales over time): line chart with moving average and annotated peaks.
- Comparison across categories: horizontal bar chart (sorted descending).
- Distribution of numeric variable: histogram or boxplot with outliers called out.
- Relationship between two variables: scatterplot + trend line; if many points, add density or hexbin.
- Part-to-whole (market share): consider bar or treemap; avoid 100% stacked bars unless necessary.

## Example GitHub README images and assets
- Add `images/thumbnail.png` (600×300) for repo display.
- Add a small `README_assets` folder with export images used in README.
